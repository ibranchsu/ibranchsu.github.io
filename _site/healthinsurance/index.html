<p><strong>Premium Rates and Coverage Dates</strong></p>

<p>The University worked closely with its health insurance broker to maintain the premium rate for 2019-20.  The annual rate for 2019-20 is anticipated to be $1,730, which includes a $45 administrative fee.  The administrative fee covers expenses incurred to ensure compliance with the health insurance requirement, to manage the enrollment process, and to provide dedicated, on-campus support to students enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan.</p>

<p>The premium rate for fall-only coverage is $749.</p>

<p>The premium rate for spring-only coverage is $1,026.</p>

<p>The coverage dates for the 2019-2020 year are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2019-20 Academic Year: August 1, 2019 – July 31, 2020</li>
  <li>Fall 2019 Only: August 1, 2019 – December 31, 2019</li>
  <li>Spring 2020 Only: January 1, 2020 – July 31, 2020</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Managing Costs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Student Health Insurance Plan Premium</strong></p>

<p>The Student Health Insurance Plan premium will be applied to students’ Bursar’s bill. Those seeking to discuss their payment options should contact the Bursar’s Office at 315.443.2444 or bursar@syr.edu.</p>

<p><strong>Claims Costs</strong></p>

<p>The 2019-2020 Student Health Insurance Plan is a co-pay/co-insurance model, meaning that students are paying a standard co-pay for visits and possibly a portion of their bill based on the services rendered. Out-of-pocket expenses can be minimized by seeking medically-necessary care at the most appropriate medical facility. For example, students can visit Health Services, located on campus, for a number of health care needs.  There are several urgent care facilities located near campus that are open between the hours of 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. for non-emergency care.  Check whether they participate in your insurer’s network before you visit so you know what coverage to expect.</p>

<p>Understanding your plan and benefits can help you minimize your costs – consider exclusions, referral requirements, and appropriate emergency room usage when considering your options, and use in-network providers whenever possible to help reduce potential costs.</p>

<p>Students with concerns regarding their bills or claims should contact the Student Health Insurance Office at 315.443.9019 to set up an appointment. Students should bring their insurance card and any documentation and bills with them to the appointment.</p>
