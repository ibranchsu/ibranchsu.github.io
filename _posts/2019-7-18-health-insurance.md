Source: http://healthinsurance.syr.edu/  
           
All full-time, matriculated undergraduate, graduate and law students are eligible for the Student Health Insurance Plan. Once per academic year, eligible students must enroll in or waive out of the Student Health Insurance Plan with alternate qualifying coverage through their MySlice account.      
      
The Student Health Insurance Plan is currently insured and administered by Aetna Student Health. This plan is ACA-compliant, provided by a U.S.-based insurer, and includes emergency and non-emergency coverage in the Syracuse area.         
       
**Plan Details, Brochure, and Benefit Highlights**    
       
The 2019-20 Student Health Insurance Plan offers a platinum-rated plan that features comprehensive health insurance coverage. Access the Syracuse University Plan Highlight Sheet for a brief summary.     
     
The full 2019-20 Plan Design and Benefits Summary will be available later this summer.      
                
**How to Enroll**      
          
Eligible full-time matriculated undergraduate, graduate and law students, including graduate assistants, teaching assistants, research assistants and fellows, can enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan on MySlice.     
- To enroll:
- Log into MySlice with your SU NetID and password
- Under the Student Services section, find the Student Health Insurance header and click ‘Health Insurance Enroll/Waive’
- Click ‘Enroll’
- Complete the enrollment form and click ‘Submit’  
        
Please allow up to 10 days for processing. Your insurance card will be available to print online on the Aetna Student Health page once processed.       
       
**Waiving the Student Health Insurance Plan**     
        
Some students may already have access to qualifying health insurance coverage. To waive the Student Health Insurance Plan, students must provide proof of qualifying coverage through MySlice annually by the published deadline.      
         
The deadline to waive is September 16, 2019. After September 16, only prorated refunds will be available.     
           
Qualifying coverage is defined as follows:
- Provided by a U.S.-based insurer*
- Covers emergency and non-emergency services in the Syracuse area
- Compliant with all aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)   
       
Please note, most New York State Essential Plan tiers do not meet our requirements. Please email the Student Health Insurance Office if you have questions.     
     
**Insurance carriers or their subsidiaries outside the 50 U.S. states or coverage by foreign National Health Services programs are not acceptable under this criterion.  Some of these plans may advertise that they are ACA-compliant and provide a U.S. address; however, many are not filed and approved in the U.S., which is required to be accepted as alternate qualifying coverage.**     
       
If you are currently enrolled in an out-of-New York State or New York City Medicaid plan, please email the Student Health Insurance Office.     
       
**Qualifying Coverage Considerations**   
     
Here are some required standards:
- Carrier is licensed to do business in the U.S., has a U.S. phone number, and a U.S. claims payment office.
- Does not have waiting periods prior to providing coverage for pre-existing conditions.
- Does not have exclusions for mental health disorders, pre-existing conditions, pregnancy and pregnancy-related treatment, and drug and alcohol-related conditions.
- Coverage is duration of the academic year or until the academic program end.
- Unlimited yearly and unlimited maximum benefit.
To Waive:

- Under the Student Services section, find the Student Health Insurance header and click ‘Health Insurance Enroll/Waive’
- Click ‘Waive’
- Complete the waiver form, including uploading a copy of your health insurance card
- Click ‘Submit’

**Managing Costs**      
      
**Student Health Insurance Plan Premium**    
     
The Student Health Insurance Plan premium will be applied to students’ Bursar’s bill. Those seeking to discuss their payment options should contact the Bursar’s Office at 315.443.2444 or bursar@syr.edu.    
       

**Claims Costs**    
      
The 2019-2020 Student Health Insurance Plan is a co-pay/co-insurance model, meaning that students are paying a standard co-pay for visits and possibly a portion of their bill based on the services rendered. Out-of-pocket expenses can be minimized by seeking medically-necessary care at the most appropriate medical facility. For example, students can visit Health Services, located on campus, for a number of health care needs.  There are several urgent care facilities located near campus that are open between the hours of 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. for non-emergency care.  Check whether they participate in your insurer’s network before you visit so you know what coverage to expect.      
      
Understanding your plan and benefits can help you minimize your costs – consider exclusions, referral requirements, and appropriate emergency room usage when considering your options, and use in-network providers whenever possible to help reduce potential costs.     
     
Students with concerns regarding their bills or claims should contact the Student Health Insurance Office at 315.443.9019 to set up an appointment. Students should bring their insurance card and any documentation and bills with them to the appointment.
